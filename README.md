# GAN on flickrfaceshq dataset

The motivation for this project was the author's desire to "create", more specifically -- a keen interest in generative models. In this project the default GAN model is constructed and trained on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/flickrfaceshq-dataset-ffhq) of human faces.
